# Clubbernaut
Proud project presented by Simple Swag Syncidate! We aim to provide a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing Club organization Web App for the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Since we are not officially supported by the university, we will also be utilizing its existing solution Campus Pulse for certain features. Our goal is to provide more visual aid and simplify website interactions rather than replacing Campus Pulse. We hope our project will promote more students to participate and enjoy Club activities!
